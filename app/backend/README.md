## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to set up, run, and deploy the backend application. The backend application is designed to handle all the server-side operations of our system, including processing requests, managing database interactions, and executing appropriate responses.

## Getting Started
To set up the project locally, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine. Ensure that you have the necessary software installed, such as Node.js and MongoDB.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Postman (for testing API endpoints)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies.
4. Start the MongoDB server.
5. Run `npm start` to start the backend server.

## API Endpoints
The backend application provides several API endpoints for managing data. These include endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data. All requests and responses are in JSON format.

## Error Handling
The application has robust error handling. If an error occurs, the server will respond with an error message in a consistent format. This includes HTTP status code, error type, and a brief description of the error.

## Testing
Automated tests can be run using the `npm test` command. These tests cover all the API endpoints and ensure that they are working as expected.

## Deployment
To deploy the application on a live system, you can use platforms like Heroku or AWS. Make sure to set up the environment variables correctly for the production environment.
